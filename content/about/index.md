Hi, I'm **Binh**.

I'm a **Fullstack IoT Developer** in Budapest and well... I like to make things in my free time.

Ever since I was a kid, I had an urge to discover. Whether it is opening up a toy car to learn its mechanism or destroying pop's TV for an experiment, nothing has stopped my curiosity from fulfilling itself.

Later on, I used this energy to learn new skills that would help me on my path as a Maker. From photography to web development, I always try to learn as much as possible.

As a wise person from the Internet once said **"Sharing is the best way to learn"**, Binh's Archive was created with one purpose in mind: **to inspire and to learn**. Sharing is my next step in truly harnessing knowledge.

If you are entering the Developer Community and want to know something new or cool, I hope this blog will be a good place for you. Through my projects, you'll be learning with me, making mistakes with me. We will help each other and grow together.

Feel free to reach me at binhpham@binhph.am

_Imagine. Create. Inspire._
