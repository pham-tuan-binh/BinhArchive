# Thank you note

**Memory Catalog** was an idea from a friend of mine, designed and developed by me.

Through this article, I want to say thank you for having given me such an amazing idea.

# Introduction

To people who have followed me on Instagram, **Memory Catalog** is no stranger.

Everything started when my friend wanted me to develop her own website for storing notes and memories from her friend.

At the point, to do such thing, students in Viet Nam would resort to form platforms such as Google From, Type Form or a physical notebook. However, these sites have their disadvantages: lack of customization, expensive, time-costly,...

And she wanted it to be unique. So I developed a new way of storing notes online, **Online Memory as Polaroid**, and I called it **Memory Catalog**.

# What is Memory Catalog?

**Memory Catalog** is a place where you can share your memories with me. Instead of writing farewell notes, you can share **pictures and stories** about places we have been together, dishes we have had,... These photos are then stored as **Polaroid** on my website, either privately or publicly and can be viewed eternaly throughout the universe (with internet connection).

You can see how you can upload a Polaroid on this video.

# The making of Memory Catalog

It might be a suprise, but it only took me 14 hours to do this project. This project was made in a **12hr** Hackathon. I failed obviously, lol, but I did manage to finish it with an additional 2 hours.
