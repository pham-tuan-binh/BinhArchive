# Overall

The artwork behind this article is inspired by [**Everything Everywhere All At Once**'s poster](https://clios.com/entertainment/winner/124169), in which googly eyes are formed tightly on a flat plane.

The first time I saw this poster, I had an idea to make it into an **interactive art installation** where the eyes follow the movement of a human stading in front of them. The video below is a small demo of **Circle Packing** and **Object tracking based on the newest entity** in this artwork.

Although it sounds silly, it requires a strong base of **Math and Physics** as well as **Creative Coding** experience. Using **p5.js and PoseNet**, this wall of googly eyes can **track a human** using just a normal camera or do **effects based on the number of people in its view**. Furthermore, it can be **implemented on websites** as backgrounds or interactive games due to its browser-friendly nature.

Currently, this is **private work** and is not open-sourced in any way. For display purpose, this interactive installation can be **modified and installed on demand**. Please contact me for further developments and collaboration.
