In the second part, we will discover:\nWhat is a Neural Network and how to implement it in C++? What is a State Machine and how to implement it in C++? Since the topics presented in this article have been on other articles, we will only go through the idea and basics of the implementations. For the in-depth explaination, I will leave it to the critical mindset of readers.\nIntroduction to Neural Network 1. Basics of Neural Network In the world of buzz words like Atificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, Neural Network must be no stranger to every engineer. In the fundamentals of it, it is just a huge mathematic equation of random coefficents that has tons of inputs and outputs.\nOf course, saying something of such complexity as a Neural Network like that would be insanely hard to comprehend and calculate. Therefore, we abstract it in the form of a graph.\nSource: https://www.v7labs.com/blog/neural-network-architectures-guide In such a graph, each node is an equation. The number of variables of this equation is equal to the number of inputs of nodes. Each variable is accomodated with a weight or a coeficient in mathematical sense. This is all summed up and put in an activation function.\nSource: https://morioh.com/p/d70aa769173a If you are wondering, the activation function is to introduce non-linearity into the network, because if every node is just a first order function of variables it would be just a bunch of lines intersecting each other. You can find more information about activation functions here.\nSource: https://www.v7labs.com/blog/neural-networks-activation-functions After constructing the nodes, you will see that the Neural Network is actually very simple. And the only question left behind is how to implement it in code from scratch.\n2. Implementation of Neural Network Currently, there is 2 main approaches:\nImplementing the network with an object-oriented approach: This means we abstract the network into nodes, layers and network classes. This is very memory consuming and not optimized at all, but very understandle and maintainable for newcomers. Implemting the network with linear algebra: This means all calculations of nodes can be put into vectors and matrixes. This is very optimized and fast with hardware acceleration and it is the fundamentals behind every Neural Network engine right now. If you guessed I picked the second option to implement, you are right! To me, nothing is better than the fusion of math and programming. It is just sad that many students don’t feel this way.\nTo know how matrices can be used in Neural Network, you can find it in these links: Neural Networks, Structure, Weights and Matrices and Neural Network Representation.\nSource: https://www.jeremyjordan.me/intro-to-neural-networks/ The most curcial information you need to get from these articles is how to build the weight and bias matrices. In addition to this, you must know how to do a foward pass: how to calculate the output of each node using the weight and bias matrix.\nFrom this point, you will be introduced to the world of back propagration to answer the question of how is the Neural Network trained. Quite suprisingly, it might actually be more dull than you think.\n3. Optimization of Neural Network In the case of Neural Network, since everything can be represented in the mathematical form. It means that you can build and graph a function of errors based on the coefficients.\nWhen you have the graph of the function, you will see that by using calculus, you can find the derivative of the function and create a direction vector pointing the extrema or minimum of the function. This is the fundamental of backward propagation.\nSource: https://towardsdatascience.com/gradient-descent-3a7db7520711 To research more on this subject, you can look into Matt Mazur’s Simple Backward Propagation Example. This explains how you can build the gradient function and the gradient matrix from a mathematical point of view.\nSource: https://mattmazur.com/2015/03/17/a-step-by-step-backpropagation-example/ In this article’s example of a neural network, you can also see that instead of using matrices and linear algebra, the author uses nodes and layers classes. The purpose of this is purely educational as it comprimises performance for ease of reading.\nIf you have reached this point, you have everything it needs to read the source code of the neural network of the project.\nIntroduction to State Machine 1. Basics of State Machine Source: https://micromouseonline.com/2014/05/05/state-machines-introduction/ If you have ever been to the Front-end realm of any kind of application development, you will know that they are based on states and props. Cough… React Cough… Vue Cough… Svelte.\nCreating a State Management System for React from scratchSource: https://dev.to/logeekal/building-state-management-system-like-react-from-scratch-with-vanillajs-3eon While this statement might be wrong because it is different with each framework and library, every front-end is definately based on a state machine.\nActually maybe everything in programming and computers in general is based on a state machine. But this is such an abstract concept that developers often don’t even care. In Binh’s Archive though, we care.\nA Turing State Machine SchematicSource: https://machinedeturing.com/ang_fonctionnement.php?page=7 Since this project needs an user interface, it has to implement a State Machine from scratch. This helps the application render with ease and efficiency.\nThe basic form of a state machine is having states and each state is connected to actions.\nSource: https://statecharts.dev/what-is-a-state-machine.html For example, in off state, if we flip the light switch, it will move to the on stage. In the polling for the switch transition at the off state, we need to define an activity that constantly look for the state of the switch. This is basically how some basic websites works, by constantly looking for changes and re-render the DOM.\n2. Implementation of State Machine Example State Transition Table for a Sequential MachineSource: https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Example-State-Transition-Table-for-a-Sequential-Machine-Source-Hatley-and-Pirbhai_fig10_269710922 In C++ and C, there is pretty neat trick you can do to implement a transition table. By storing functions into an array, you can call the transition function seamlessly by calling the array at the state index.\nBelow is a code snippet taken from the source code of this project:\nclass Controller { private: int currentState; bool renderFlag; void printBanner(); void generationMenu(); void controlMenu(); void createNetwork(); void trainNetwork(); void testNetwork(); void loadNetwork(); void saveNetwork(); void exit(); Action stateTransitions[8]; public: Controller() { stateTransitions[GEN_MENU] = \u0026Controller::generationMenu; stateTransitions[CREATE] = \u0026Controller::createNetwork; stateTransitions[LOAD] = \u0026Controller::loadNetwork; stateTransitions[CONTROL_MENU] = \u0026Controller::controlMenu; stateTransitions[TRAIN] = \u0026Controller::trainNetwork; stateTransitions[TEST] = \u0026Controller::testNetwork; stateTransitions[SAVE] = \u0026Controller::saveNetwork; stateTransitions[EXIT] = \u0026Controller::exit; }; void render() { (this-\u003e*stateTransitions[currentState])(); } ; }; As you can see, the logic behind the user interface of this project is pretty simple. By leveraging the theory of State Machine, we can easily create transition function to move between different states and in each state we can display the corresponding information.\n// Example function void Controller::saveNetwork() { // Display something cout \u003c\u003c \"save network menu\"; // Doing something ofstream save_file; save_file.open(\"./data/network.txt\"); n-\u003esaveNetwork(save_file); save_file.close(); // Change state currentState = CONTROL_MENU; } Since this is a state machine, we can let this function run on an infinite loop and the system would only change the output when there is a state change or an explicit exit from the function.\n// Infinite loop in program Controller a; while (a.renderFlag) { a.render(); } The simplicity of this code snippet is why I love the theory part of Computer Science.\nUsing the knowledge presented in these sections, you can now read everything inside the source code of the project.\nEnd note I know that this can be a little bit too much of information for such a small article. However, as an engineer myself, I have always wanted an article like this to read so that I can find everything and branch out from one place.\nUsing this article, you can have the base for researching more on State Machine and Neural Network. You can also train yourself to have a new mindset in programming and ignite your passion in the theories of Computer Science and Mathematics.\n","wordCount":"1314","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://binhph.am/posts/guide-neural-network/posts/guide-neural-network/images/banner.png","datePublished":"2023-05-27T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-05-27T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Binh Pham"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://binhph.am/posts/guide-neural-network/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Binh's Archive","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://binhph.am/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://binhph.am accesskey=h title="Binh's Archive (Alt + H)">Binh's Archive</a>
